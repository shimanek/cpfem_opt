# Other modules

The runnable modules, `run` and `plot`, rely on the following modules:

- [Core](../API/core.html): contains modules used for most applications
- [Engines](../API/engines.html): interfaces with the FEA program
- [Objectives](../API/objectives.html): provides objective functions for the optimization
- [Models](../API/models.html): constructs geometric models for use in the FEA
