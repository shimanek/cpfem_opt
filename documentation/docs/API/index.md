# Other modules

The runnable modules, `run` and `plot`, rely on the following modules:

- [Core](core.md): contains modules used for most applications
- [Engines](engines.md): interfaces with the FEA program
- [Objectives](objectives.md): provides objective functions for the optimization
- [Models](models.md): constructs geometric models for use in the FEA
